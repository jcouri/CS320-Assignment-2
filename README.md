# CS320-Assignment-2
Program 1 takes an input of at most 65 characters and takes each word separated by a space and prints each word individually surroundend by two equal signs. Program 2 separates each word in the same way as program 1 but it checks to see if each word is an int. If the word is not an int, it is specified as a string. Program 3 performs just like program 2 if the number of words is less than 3, otherwise it asks for less words. Program 4 performs just like program 3 except after the input, it checks if each character spells out "quit" and terminates if it does. It also checks for an extra condition that the number of characters is less than 20 and if it is it performs like program 2 & 3. Program 5 is just like program 4 except it only prints if the words are str and int if there's two words and str if there's one word. Program 6 takes one int as an argument. It checks to see if there was only one input after ./a.out (if argc = 2) and then checks if that input is an int. If both conditions are satisfied, it runs just like program 5.
